How it works

The Sign Up Form is created using HTML and CSS. The form consists of several input fields for the user to enter their personal information, such as name, email, and password. The form is styled using CSS to make it responsive and visually appealing. The form also includes some basic client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that the user has entered valid input before submitting the form.
